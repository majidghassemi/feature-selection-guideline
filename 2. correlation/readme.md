# Correlation between features

> ## We have 3 different scenarios in this case:   


- ### When our independent feature(s) is highly correlated with independent feature(s), We have to keep those independents


- ### When our independent feature(s) isn't related to independet, We can (It's better actually) remove them 


- ### When our independent features are correlated with other independent features, We can (It's better actually) to keep just one of them
